You may use the Fit.AI Services only as permitted by law. The licenses granted by Fit.AI terminate if you do not comply with these Conditions of Use or any Service Terms.

## Your Account

You may need your own Fit.AI account to use certain Fit.AI Services, and you may be required to be logged in to the account and have a valid payment method associated with it. If there is a problem charging your selected payment method, we may charge any other valid payment method associated with your account. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password and for restricting access to your account, and you agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account or password. Fit.AI does not sell products for children, but it sells them to adults, who can purchase with a credit card or other permitted payment method. If you are under 18, you may use the Fit.AI Services only with involvement of a parent or guardian. Fit.AI reserves the right to refuse service, terminate accounts, terminate your rights to use Fit.AI Services, remove or edit content, or cancel orders in its sole discretion.

## Reviews, Comments, Communications, and Other Content

You may post reviews, comments, photos, videos, and other content; and submit suggestions, ideas, comments, questions, or other information, so long as the content is not illegal, obscene, threatening, defamatory, invasive of privacy, infringing of intellectual property rights (including publicity rights), or otherwise injurious to third parties or objectionable, and does not consist of or contain software viruses, political campaigning, commercial solicitation, chain letters, mass mailings, or any form of "spam" or unsolicited commercial electronic messages. You may not use a false e-mail address, impersonate any person or entity, or otherwise mislead as to the origin of content. Fit.AI reserves the right (but not the obligation) to remove or edit such content, but does not regularly review posted content.

If you do post content or submit material, and unless we indicate otherwise, you grant Fit.AI a nonexclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, and fully sublicensable right to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, perform, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, and display such content throughout the world in any media. You grant Fit.AI and sublicensees the right to use the name that you submit in connection with such content, if they choose. You represent and warrant that you own or otherwise control all of the rights to the content that you post; that the content is accurate; that use of the content you supply does not violate this policy and will not cause injury to any person or entity; and that you will indemnify Fit.AI for all claims resulting from content you supply. Fit.AI has the right but not the obligation to monitor and edit or remove any activity or content. Fit.AI takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any content posted by you or any third party.

## Intellectual Property Complaints

Fit.AI respects the intellectual property of others. If you believe that your intellectual property rights are being infringed, please follow our Notice and Procedure for Making Claims of Copyright Infringement.

## Risk of Loss

All purchases of physical items from Fit.AI are made pursuant to a shipment contract. This means that the risk of loss and title for such items pass to you upon our delivery to the carrier.

## Returns, Refunds and Title

Fit.AI does not take title to returned items until the item arrives at our fulfillment center. At our discretion, a refund may be issued without requiring a return. In this situation, Fit.AI does not take title to the refunded item.

## Product Descriptions

Fit.AI attempts to be as accurate as possible. However, Fit.AI does not warrant that product descriptions or other content of any Fit.AI Service is accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free. If a product offered by Fit.AI itself is not as described, your sole remedy is to return it in unused condition.

## Pricing

With respect to items sold by Fit.AI, we cannot confirm the price of an item until you order. Despite our best efforts, a small number of the items in our catalog may be mispriced. If the correct price of an item sold by Fit.AI is higher than our stated price, we will, at our discretion, either contact you for instructions before shipping or cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation. Other merchants may follow different policies in the event of a mispriced item.

We generally do not charge your credit card until after your order has entered the shipping process or, for digital products, until we make the digital product available to you.

## App Permissions

When you use apps created by Fit.AI, such as the Fit.AI App, you may grant certain permissions to us for your device. Most mobile devices provide you with information about these permissions.

## Sanctions and Export Policy

You may not use any Fit.AI Service if you are the subject of sanctions consistent with the laws of the country where you are using Fit.AI Services. You must comply with all export and re-export restrictions that may apply to goods, software, technology, and services.

## Other Businesses

Parties other than Fit.AI operate stores, provide services or software, or sell product lines through the Fit.AI Services. In addition, we provide links to the sites of affiliated companies and certain other businesses. If you purchase any of the products or services offered by these businesses or individuals, you are purchasing directly from those third parties, not from Fit.AI. We are not responsible for examining or evaluating, and we do not warrant, the offerings of any of these businesses or individuals (including the content of their Web sites). Fit.AI does not assume any responsibility or liability for the actions, product, and content of all these and any other third parties. You should carefully review their privacy statements and other conditions of use.

This Privacy Notice describes how Fit.AI and its affiliates (collectively "Fit.AI") collect and process your personal information through Fit.AI applications, websites, products, and services that reference this Privacy Notice (together "Fit.AI Services"). **By using Fit.AI Services, you are consenting to the practices described in this Privacy Notice.**


## What Personal Information About Customers Does Fit.AI Collect?

We collect your personal information in order to provide and continually improve our products and services.

Here are the types of personal information we collect:

- **Information You Give Us:** We receive and store any information you provide in relation to Fit.AI Services. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our Fit.AI Services.
- **Automatic Information:** We automatically collect and store certain types of information about your use of Fit.AI Services, including information about your interaction with products, content, and services available through Fit.AI Services. Like many websites, we use "cookies" and other unique identifiers, and we obtain certain types of information when your web browser or device accesses Fit.AI Services and other content served by or on behalf of Fit.AI on other websites.
- **Information from Other Sources:** We might receive information about you from other sources, such as updated delivery and address information from our carriers, which we use to correct our records and deliver your next purchase more easily.

## For What Purposes Does Fit.AI Use Your Personal Information?

We use your personal information to operate, provide, develop, and improve the products and services that we offer our customers. These purposes include:

- **Purchase and delivery of products and services.** We use your personal information to take and handle orders, deliver products and services, process payments, and communicate with you about orders, products and services, and promotional offers.
- **Provide, troubleshoot, and improve Fit.AI Services.** We use your personal information to provide functionality, analyze performance, fix errors, and improve the usability and effectiveness of the Fit.AI Services.
- **Recommendations and personalization.** We use your personal information to recommend features, products, and services that might be of interest to you, identify your preferences, and personalize your experience with Fit.AI Services.
- **Provide voice, image, and camera services.** When you use our voice, image, and camera services, we use your voice input, images, videos, and other personal information to respond to your requests, provide the requested service to you, and improve our services.
- **Comply with legal obligations.** In certain cases, we collect and use your personal information to comply with laws.
- **Communicate with you.** We use your personal information to communicate with you in relation to Fit.AI Services via different channels (e.g., by phone, email, chat).
- **Advertising.** We use your personal information to display interest-based ads for features, products, and services that might be of interest to you. We do not use information that personally identifies you to display interest-based ads.
- **Fraud Prevention and Credit Risks.** We use personal information to prevent and detect fraud and abuse in order to protect the security of our customers, Fit.AI, and others. We may also use scoring methods to assess and manage credit risks.

## What About Cookies and Other Identifiers?

To enable our systems to recognize your browser or device and to provide and improve Fit.AI Services, we use cookies and other identifiers. For more information about cookies and how we use them, please read our Cookies Notice.

## Does Fit.AI Share Your Personal Information?

Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling our customers' personal information to others. We share customers' personal information only as described below and with subsidiaries Fit.AI controls that either are subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice.

- **Transactions involving Third Parties:** We make available to you services, products, applications, or skills provided by third parties for use on or through Fit.AI Services. We also offer services or sell product lines jointly with third-party businesses. You can tell when a third party is involved in your transactions, and we share customers' personal information related to those transactions with that third party.
- **Third-Party Service Providers:** We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders for products or services, delivering packages, sending postal mail and email, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing payments, transmitting content, scoring, assessing and managing credit risk, and providing customer service. These third-party service providers have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.
- **Business Transfers:** As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy other businesses or services. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Fit.AI or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
- **Protection of Fit.AI and Others:** We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Fit.AI, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when personal information about you might be shared with third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.

## How Secure Is Information About Me?

We design our systems with your security and privacy in mind.

- We work to protect the security of your personal information during transmission by using encryption protocols and software.
- We follow the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) when handling credit card data.
- We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage, and disclosure of customer personal information. Our security procedures mean that we may ask to verify your identity before we disclose personal information to you.
- It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computers, devices, and applications. We recommend using a unique password for your Fit.AI account that is not used for other online accounts. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.

## What About Advertising?

- **Third-Party Advertisers and Links to Other Websites:** Fit.AI Services may include third-party advertising and links to other websites and apps. Third-party advertising partners may collect information about you when you interact with their content, advertising, and services.
- **Use of Third-Party Advertising Services:** We provide ad companies with information that allows them to serve you with more useful and relevant Fit.AI ads and to measure their effectiveness. We never share your name or other information that directly identifies you when we do this. Instead, we use an advertising identifier like a cookie or a device identifier. Some ad companies also use this information to serve you relevant ads from other advertisers.

## What Information Can I Access?

You can access your information, including your name, address, payment options, profile information, and purchase history in the "Your Account" section of the website.

## What Choices Do I Have?

If you have any questions as to how we collect and use your personal information, please contact our Customer Service. Many of our Fit.AI Services also include settings that provide you with options as to how your information is being used.

- As described above, you can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of the Fit.AI Services.
- You can add or update certain information on pages such as those referenced in "What Information Can I Access?" When you update information, we usually keep a copy of the prior version for our records.
- If you do not want to receive email or other communications from us, please adjust your Customer Communication Preferences. If you don't want to receive in-app notifications from us, please adjust your notification settings in the app or device.
- The Help feature on most browsers and devices will tell you how to prevent your browser or device from accepting new cookies or other identifiers, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to block cookies altogether. Because cookies and identifiers allow you to take advantage of some essential features of Fit.AI Services, we recommend that you leave them turned on.
- If you want to browse our websites without linking the browsing history to your account, you may do so by logging out of your account and blocking cookies on your browser.
- You will also be able to opt out of certain other types of data usage by updating your settings on the applicable Fit.AI website, device, or application.

In addition, to the extent required by applicable law, you may have the right to request access to or delete your personal information. If you wish to do any of these things, please go to Data Privacy Queries. Depending on your data choices, certain services may be limited or unavailable.

## Are Children Allowed to Use Fit.AI Services?

Fit.AI does not sell products for purchase by children. We sell children's products for purchase by adults. If you are under 18, you may use Fit.AI Services only with the involvement of a parent or guardian. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 without the consent of the child's parent or guardian.

## Conditions of Use, Notices, and Revisions

If you choose to use Fit.AI Services, your use and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Notice and our Conditions of Use, including limitations on damages, resolution of disputes, and application of the law of the jurisdiction where Fit.AI is headquartered. If you have any concern about privacy at Fit.AI, please contact us with a thorough description, and we will try to resolve it. Our business changes constantly, and our Privacy Notice will change also. You should check our websites frequently to see recent changes. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Notice applies to all information that we have about you and your account. We stand behind the promises we make, however, and will never materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of customer information collected in the past without the consent of affected customers.
